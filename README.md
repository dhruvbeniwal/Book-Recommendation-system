# Book Recommender System

This is a **Book Recommender System** built from scratch using **Flask**, **Machine Learning**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**. The system provides book recommendations based on user input and makes use of various machine learning techniques for content-based and collaborative filtering.

### Features

- **Personalized Book Recommendations**: The system suggests books based on user input (e.g., book title).
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses TF-IDF vectorization to recommend books with similar descriptions.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends books based on similar user behaviors (can be added later as an enhancement).
- **Responsive Design**: Built with **Bootstrap 5** to ensure a smooth experience across all devices.
- **Simple User Interface**: A minimalist dark theme with a yellow accent color for easy navigation.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML5**: Structuring the content of the application.
  - **CSS3**: Custom styles for the website.
  - **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive design and UI components.
  
- **Backend**:
  - **Flask**: Web framework used to create the server and handle HTTP requests.
  - **Machine Learning**: For recommending books based on user input using techniques like **Content-Based Filtering** and **TF-IDF**.

- **Data**: 
  - Books data (e.g., titles, descriptions) stored in a CSV format.
